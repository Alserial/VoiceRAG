# Using VoiceRAG in Microsoft Teams

## What is VoiceRAG for Teams?

VoiceRAG for Teams is a Microsoft Teams bot that gives you instant access to your organization's knowledge base through natural conversation. Simply ask questions in your Teams chat, and get answers based on your company's documents and information.

## Getting Started

### Installing the VoiceRAG Bot

1. Open Microsoft Teams and navigate to your team or channel where you want to use VoiceRAG
2. Click the **Apps** icon in the left sidebar
3. Search for "VoiceRAG" or "Knowledge Assistant"
4. Click **Add** to install the bot to your team or personal chat
5. The bot will appear in your chat list with the name "VoiceRAG Bot"

### First Conversation

1. Open a chat with VoiceRAG Bot (you can message it personally or in a channel)
2. Type `@VoiceRAG Bot` followed by your question
3. Wait for the bot to search your knowledge base and respond
4. The bot will provide answers and cite sources when available

## How to Use

### Asking Questions

You can ask questions in natural language, just like talking to a colleague:

**Examples:**
- "What is our vacation policy?"
- "How do I submit an expense report?"
- "What are the benefits for full-time employees?"
- "Tell me about the whistleblower policy"

### Understanding Responses

When the bot answers your question, it will:

1. **Provide a direct answer** based on information in your knowledge base
2. **Show source documents** if available (click to view the original document)
3. **Use general knowledge** if specific information isn't in the knowledge base

**Note:** If the question is completely unrelated to your organization's documents, the bot will do its best to help using general knowledge, but it may suggest checking with your internal resources.

### Conversational Context

The bot remembers your conversation during the current chat session. You can ask follow-up questions like:

1. "What are our vacation policies?"
2. "Does that include personal days?" (follow-up)
3. "How do I request time off?" (follow-up)

The bot understands these follow-up questions in the context of your previous conversation.

### Sharing in Channels

You can use VoiceRAG in Teams channels:

1. Post questions to the channel using `@VoiceRAG Bot`
2. Other team members can see and benefit from the answers
3. Use threaded replies to ask follow-up questions

## Capabilities

### Search the Knowledge Base

The bot searches across all documents in your organization's knowledge base, including:
- Employee handbooks
- Policy documents
- Benefits information
- Company overviews
- Role descriptions
- And other uploaded documents

### Multi-language Support

The bot responds in English by default. While you can ask questions in different languages, the bot will respond in English to ensure consistent understanding across your organization.

### Getting Additional Help

If you need clarification or want to explore a topic further:

1. Ask follow-up questions in the same chat
2. Try rephrasing your question if the answer wasn't what you expected
3. Be specific about what information you need

**Example of a better question:**
- Instead of: "tell me about benefits"
- Try: "what health insurance options are available for new employees?"

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific

The more specific your question, the better the answer. Compare:

**Vague:** "What about benefits?"
**Specific:** "What dental insurance coverage do we offer?"

### Use Natural Language

You don't need to use specific keywords. Ask questions as you would ask a colleague:

**Good:** "How many vacation days do new employees get?"
**Unnecessary:** "vacation days policy employee handbook"

### One Question at a Time

For best results, ask one question at a time, wait for the response, then ask follow-up questions:

**Better approach:**
1. "What is our parental leave policy?"
2. (Wait for answer)
3. "Is that paid or unpaid leave?"

## Privacy and Security

- All conversations are private to your chat or channel
- The bot only accesses documents that have been uploaded to your organization's knowledge base
- No conversation data is stored permanently beyond the current session
- Your organization's admins control which documents are available in the knowledge base

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding

If the bot doesn't respond:

1. Check that the bot is properly installed in your Teams
2. Make sure you're addressing the bot correctly with `@VoiceRAG Bot`
3. Try sending a simple message like "Hello" first

### Unsatisfactory Answers

If you're not getting the information you need:

1. Try rephrasing your question with more specific terms
2. Check if your topic is likely to be in the knowledge base
3. For organization-specific information, ask your manager or HR

### Missing Information

If the bot says the information isn't in the knowledge base:

1. The bot will still try to help with general knowledge
2. Consult your organization's official resources for authoritative information
3. Contact your IT admin to add specific documents to the knowledge base

## Common Use Cases

## Limitations

### Text Only

VoiceRAG for Teams works with text-based chat only. Voice conversations are not supported in Teams (though the web version supports voice interaction).

### Knowledge Base Scope

The bot can only answer based on documents that have been uploaded to your organization's knowledge base. It cannot access:
- Private files or documents
